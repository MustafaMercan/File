## FlowBite 

 This project aims to develop a platform similar to Google Drive, allowing multiple clients to upload their own documents, files, and images to a server and optionally share these documents with other users. Essentially, it's a project resembling Google Drive. The purpose of this project is to enhance my skills in the MERN stack technology and delve deeper into this field.
